Hello,

we fixed the minor restriciveness issue on x in the generation.

But as for the "bug" in our signing, we can't see what is wrong
with it, nor can't we interpret what we should do with
your counterexample.

The counterexample definetly can be verified after signing.
We have

(1) created a QC property (no input args) that tests your
    counterexample in a pure environment, it passes.

(2) ran our program on your counterexample and created
    the corresponding "verify"-file *counterverify* (attached).
    that one also outputs valid signature?

Maybe the signing works? Or maybe you can give further steps
of reproducing faulty behavior.
